## What's here?

**Logger.log("shsw228")** is a blog where @shsw228 records daily thoughts and experiences. This blog is planned to be written in Japanese, but sometimes entries may be in English for practice. 

Though my English may be rough, I would appreciate any feedback you might have.

## Who?
I am a Software Engineer working in Tokyo.
I primarily develop iOS apps, and occasionally develop Android apps. 

My hobbies include trying out new technologies that catch my interest, drawing, and watching movies.
Although I have no knowledge of web development, I was able to create this site easily thanks to Hugo, which is also part of my hobbies.

I will be adding more about myself in the "About me" section. Please take a look if you're interested.
